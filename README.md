# lib3mf_rust

A pure Rust implementation for parsing 3MF (3D Manufacturing Format) files with **no unsafe code**.

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT%20OR%20Apache--2.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview

This library provides a pure Rust implementation for reading and parsing 3MF files, which are ZIP-based containers following the Open Packaging Conventions (OPC) standard and containing XML-based 3D model data.

The 3MF format is the modern standard for 3D printing, supporting rich model information including:
- 3D mesh geometry (vertices and triangles)
- Materials and colors
- Metadata
- Build specifications
- And more

## Features

- ✅ **Pure Rust implementation** - No C/C++ dependencies
- ✅ **No unsafe code** - Enforced with `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`
- ✅ Parse 3MF file structure (ZIP/OPC container)
- ✅ Read 3D model data including meshes, vertices, and triangles
- ✅ Support for materials and colors
- ✅ Metadata extraction
- ✅ Build item specifications
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
lib3mf = "0.1"
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```rust
use lib3mf::Model;
use std::fs::File;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Open and parse a 3MF file
    let file = File::open("model.3mf")?;
    let model = Model::from_reader(file)?;

    // Access model information
    println!("Unit: {}", model.unit);
    println!("Objects: {}", model.resources.objects.len());

    // Iterate through objects
    for obj in &model.resources.objects {
        if let Some(ref mesh) = obj.mesh {
            println!("Object {} has {} vertices and {} triangles",
                obj.id, mesh.vertices.len(), mesh.triangles.len());
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

### Running Examples

The repository includes a complete example demonstrating parsing:

```bash
cargo run --example parse_3mf
```

## Architecture

The library is organized into several modules:

- **`model`** - Data structures representing 3MF models (vertices, triangles, meshes, objects, etc.)
- **`opc`** - Open Packaging Conventions (OPC) handling for ZIP-based containers
- **`parser`** - XML parsing for 3D model files
- **`error`** - Comprehensive error types with detailed messages

## 3MF Format Support

This implementation currently supports:

- **Core 3MF Specification**
  - Model structure (resources, build, metadata)
  - Mesh geometry (vertices, triangles)
  - Object definitions
  - Build items with transformations
  - Basic materials and colors

- **Materials Extension**
  - Color groups (m:colorgroup)
  - Per-triangle material references (pid attributes)
  - Base materials with display colors

### Extension Support Status

The parser can successfully read and parse files using the following 3MF extensions:

- ✅ **Core Specification** - Fully supported
- ✅ **Materials Extension** - Color groups and base materials supported
- ⚠️  **Production Extension** - Files parse successfully, UUID attributes not yet extracted
- ⚠️  **Slice Extension** - Files parse successfully, slice data not yet extracted
- ⚠️  **Beam Lattice Extension** - Files parse successfully, beam data not yet extracted

Note: Files using extensions parse correctly and basic mesh data is extracted. 
Extension-specific data structures (beams, slices, UUIDs) are not yet fully modeled.

### Future Enhancements

Potential future additions could include:
- Full production extension support (UUID extraction, path references)
- Slice extension support (slice stacks and slice data)
- Beam lattice extension support (beam definitions and properties)
- Advanced material properties (textures, composite materials)
- Components and assemblies
- Custom extensions

## Testing

The library includes comprehensive unit, integration, and conformance tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run linter
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Run official 3MF conformance tests
cargo test --test conformance_tests summary -- --ignored --nocapture
```

### Conformance Testing

This library has been validated against the official [3MF Consortium test suites](https://github.com/3MFConsortium/test_suites), which include over 2,200 test cases covering all 3MF specifications and extensions.

**Current Conformance Results:**
- ✅ **100% Positive Test Compliance**: All 1,698 valid 3MF files parse successfully
- ⚠️ **1.7% Negative Test Compliance**: 9 out of 543 invalid files are correctly rejected

The parser successfully handles files using all 3MF extensions including:
- Core Specification (1.4.0)
- Materials & Properties Extension (1.2.1)
- Production Extension (1.2.0)
- Slice Extension (1.0.2)
- Beam Lattice Extension (1.2.0)
- Secure Content Extension (1.0.2)
- Boolean Operations Extension (1.1.1)
- Displacement Extension (1.0.0)

See [CONFORMANCE_REPORT.md](CONFORMANCE_REPORT.md) for detailed test results and analysis.

## Safety

This library is designed with safety in mind:

- **No unsafe code** - The entire codebase forbids unsafe code
- **Type safety** - Leverages Rust's type system for correctness
- **Memory safety** - All memory management is handled by Rust's ownership system
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive error types using `thiserror`

## Dependencies

The library uses minimal, well-maintained dependencies:

- `zip` - For reading ZIP archives (3MF container format)
- `quick-xml` - For parsing XML model files
- `thiserror` - For error handling

All dependencies are regularly updated and checked for vulnerabilities.
